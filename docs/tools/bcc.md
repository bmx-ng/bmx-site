`bcc` is used to translate BlitzMax source code into C code. The name "bcc" came from Blitz Code Compiler but since BlitzMax NG `bcc` became more of a transpiler.

## Command line syntax

	bcc [options]

(Note that you will need `./bcc` on *nix platforms, if you want to run bcc from the `bin` directory.)
	
### Options

#### `-q`

Tells `bcc` to be quiet. For now it does not change something in `bcc` output itself but if passed back to `bmk` this will have an effect to [`bmk`].

#### `-v`

Sets `bcc` into a verbose mode. This outputs more text information than during normal operation.

This can be useful if you want to see where stuff hangs, takes a while or just to see what happesn during compilation.

#### `-r`

Create a release mode transpile of the BlitzMax source code.

#### `-h`

Enables threading in your code file. (This is enabled as default in BlitzMax NG compilation processes).

#### `-s`

Disable "strict upgrade". This then no longer upgrades strict subclass method/function return types to match the superstrict superclass. Without this parameter (so "default") `bcc` does auto-upgrade. Set flag if you want to throw an error - because of mismatch. (Example: strict is Int, superstrict is Void).

#### `-g <architecture>`

Select for what architecture to create code. Valid architectures (for now) are: `x86`. `x64`, `pcc`, `arm`,  `arm64`, `armeabi`, `armeabiv7a`, `arm64v8a` and `js` (javascript via emscripten).

#### `-m <modulename>`

Create code for the given `modulename`.

#### `-o <output file>`

Specifies the output file. Must be full path to the outputfile (excluding final extension - there will be a .h, .c and .i generated).

#### `-p <platform>`

Select platform to create code for. Valid platforms (for now) are: 
Windows OS: `win32`
Mac OS X: `macos`
Linux: `linux`
Android: `android`
RaspberryPi: `raspberrypi`
Web / Javascript: `emscripten`

#### `-t <apptype>`

Define type of the application. Should be either `console` or `gui`.

The default is `console`.

#### `-f <framework>`

Defines to use a specific module as framework instead of importing all `brl.mod` and `pub.mod` modules.

#### `-d`

Create a debug mode transpile of the BlitzMax source code. (This is the default mode)

#### `-musl`

Enables musl libc compatibility. (Linux only)

#### `-w`

Generate warnings (and accept) instead of errors for calling methods with arguments that need to be cast down. May cause issues using overloaded methods.

#### `-nodef`

Defines to not generate .def files useable by created DLLs/shared libraries.

#### `-nohead`

Defines to not generate header files useable by created DLLs/shared libraries.

#### `-makelib`

Tells `bcc` that the generated code is used in a DLL/shared library.

#### `-override`

Sets requirement for overriding methods and functions to append `override` to their definitions.

#### `-overerr`

Defines missing `override` keywords in overridden methods and functions to be handled as error instead of warning.

#### `-ud <custom conditionals>`

Add custom conditionals (comma separated) then usable via `?myconditional`.
